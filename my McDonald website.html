    <p>McDonald's is obviously one of the best fast food restaurant in the world. One day when I was 8 years old, I went to the McDonald's located near a mall because I wanted to get 100 won(about 8 pennies at that time)by giving them my used soda cup. However, the cashier said,"you can not give you 100 Won because the cup does not have its cover", after hearing that, I was extreamly depressed so I went out then cried..alot...even heaven would have heard my grief.
      I hate McDonald's.</p>
