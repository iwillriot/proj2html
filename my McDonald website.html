    <p>McDonald's is obviously one of the best fast food restaurant in the world. One day when I was 8 years old, I went to the McDonald's located near a mall because I wanted to get 100 won(about 8 pennies at that time)by giving them my used soda cup. However, the cashier said,"you can not give you 100 Won because the cup does not have its cover", after hearing that, I was extreamly depressed so I went out then cried..alot...even heaven would have heard my grief.
      I hate McDonald's.</p>

     <h3>Why these are healthier choice?<h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Too much salt is really bad for your health.</li>
         <li>A Happy Meal is a well-balanced meal for anyone--not just kids.</li>
         <li>Salads are another good choice. A premium Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken (220 calories, 6 g fat, 890 mg sodium) with Newman's Own Low Fat Balsamic Vinaigrette (40 calories, 3 g fat, 730 mg sodium) paired with a Snack Size Fruit and Walnut Salad (210 calories, 8 g fat, 60 mg sodium) can provide a very filling and nutritious meal for a total of 470 calories, 17 g of fat and 1,680 mg of sodium.</li>
